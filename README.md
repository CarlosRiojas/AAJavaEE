# AAJavaEE Hibernate & JavaEnterprise Edition libraries

## What Did I learned?

I learned the concepts of Hibernate which is an Object Relational Mapper, it maps java classes using POJO's to map SQL databases and
manipulate them, I learned about application servers vs web servers, Model View Controller pattern through the business services using JPA
repository and how to deploy to docker.

## How is this repository structured?

The project is a reservation app and which goes through a login and reaches a home page,it uses the MVC pattern, there are five main 
packages,model,business,util,view and resources, the view model has the Client resources which holds the main business logic and holds
the Client query endpoints, it's placed as a controller aswell.
